= Incompatible Plugins =

The following plugins prevent MyCryptoCheckout from working correctly:

- Plugin Organizer by Jeff Sterup. Deactivate plugin.

= Security =

Disable the MCC currencies tab: after you have wallets setup you can prevent them from being edited in the WordPress admin. Add the following code to your wp-config file-

<code>define( 'MYCRYPTOCHECKOUT_DISABLE_WALLET_EDITOR', true );</code>

= Technical disclosure =

Upon plugin activation an account is created on the MyCryptoCheckout API server: api.mycryptocheckout.com. The only data that is sent is your WordPress install's public URL and the plugin version. The URL is used by the API server to know where to send updated account info (license status, payment statistics), exchange rates, and completed purchase notifications. The plugin version is used to help answer requests made by the plugin (different plugin versions speak to the API server differently).

If your server cannot be reached by the API server this plugin will not function.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Visit Admin > Settings > MyCryptoCheckout
3. Check that your account looks ok
4. Visit the currencies tab
5. Set up one or more currencies
6. Visit your WooCommerce payment gateway settings. The instructions included in receipt e-mails are taken from the WC MCC gateway instructions text boxes.
7. Or visit your EasyDigitalDownloads payment gateway settings. The instructions included in receipt e-mails can be included using the {mcc_instructions} e-mail tag. The text is taken from the EDD MCC payment gateway instructions text boxes.
